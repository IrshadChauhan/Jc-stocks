    review: `Firstly thanks alot sir for sharpening the concept of demand supply on which i am working with.

I have a prior knowledge of demand supply theory but somehow not working well with it, so i joined mentorship program of your's because you are senior to me in this theory....after joining i have improving myself with reserch and confidence.

Mentorship join karne se psychology improve ho rahi he and aapka stock TDA(top down approch) is on another level...and sir aapne jo community group banaya he usme aap new ideas implement kar rahe ho wo bhi bahot badhiya he jisse price actions samjna bahot easy ho raha he.

One of the best line i heard in last live session " ANY PROFIT IS BETTER THAN A LOSS" so always follow the rules.

One of the best decision i have ever made to join your mentorship and select demand supply as my base theory of trading.

Salute to you and your hardwork.`,

You genuinely invested a lot of time in my growth & helped me to gain clarity & confidence.
It's more than just mentorship- a journey to a pro trader 
Your best concept was finding WIT/MIT trades on weekend 
& your 125 Ema concept is highly recommended !

Thanx for support & I hope,  I keep growing more in your guidance

Apart from technical sessions, he clarify any additional questions or doubts individually via dms, he often responds quickly and clarify soon. For the best outcome, the mentee should also be proactive and put in the work as well.`,

He explains in depth PA of any stocks right from Back testing to TDA to what can we expect next in particular Stock. I personally got to learn something new from Mentorship batch.

    review: `I had been missing some individual support in my trading journey. Thats when I came to know about JC mentorship. I had a close look on all the charts that were shared on instagram pages. Thats when I felt that I should be joing JC mentorship program. After joining my trading and most importantly psycology has changed a lot. The live sessions, how to do TDA,how to make fav list and how to analyse sectors are my highlights points. And now recetly started with quiz section which is best. It helps me to do proper research on quiz stocks. At last thanks a lot for this program.` },
